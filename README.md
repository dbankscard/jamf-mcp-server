```json
{
  "env": {
    "JAMF_USE_ENHANCED_MODE": "true",      // Enable enhanced features (default: false)
    "JAMF_MAX_RETRIES": "3",               // Max retry attempts (default: 3)
    "JAMF_RETRY_DELAY": "1000",            // Initial retry delay in ms (default: 1000)
    "JAMF_RETRY_MAX_DELAY": "10000",       // Max retry delay in ms (default: 10000)
    "JAMF_DEBUG_MODE": "false",            // Enable debug logging (default: false)
    "JAMF_ENABLE_RETRY": "true",           // Enable automatic retries (default: true)
    "JAMF_ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING": "false",  // Enable rate limiting (default: false)
    "JAMF_ENABLE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER": "false" // Enable circuit breaker (default: false)
  }
}
```

### Error Types
The enhanced mode provides specific error types with helpful suggestions:

See [docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md](docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md) for detailed documentation.

## Development

### Local Development Setup

For local development without Claude Desktop, create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Jamf Pro credentials:
# JAMF_URL=https://your-instance.jamfcloud.com
# JAMF_CLIENT_ID=your-api-client-id
# JAMF_CLIENT_SECRET=your-api-client-secret
# JAMF_READ_ONLY=false
```

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector
```bash
npm run inspector
```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## API Requirements

This server requires:
- Jamf Pro version 10.35.0 or later
- API user with appropriate permissions
- Network access to your Jamf Pro instance

### Recommended API Permissions

For full functionality:
- Read access to computers, policies, scripts
- Update access for inventory updates
- Execute access for policies and scripts

For read-only mode:
- Read access to computers only

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your API credentials
- Ensure the API user has the required permissions
- Check network connectivity to Jamf Pro

### Tool Execution Failures
- Verify device IDs are correct
- Ensure policies/scripts exist in Jamf Pro
- Check that devices are online and managed

### Performance
- Large inventory requests may take time
- Use search filters to limit results
- Consider implementing pagination for large datasets

### Configuration Profiles
- The Classic API returns computer configuration profiles under `os_x_configuration_profiles` (with underscores)
- Mobile device profiles are returned under `configuration_profiles`
- Profile details use `os_x_configuration_profile` (singular) for computers
- The API clients handle these field name variations automatically

## Security Considerations

- Store credentials securely (use environment variables)
- Use read-only mode when write access isn't needed
- Regularly rotate API credentials
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Implement IP allowlisting in Jamf Pro if possible
