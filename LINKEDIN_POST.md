# LinkedIn Post - Jamf MCP Connector for ChatGPT

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: A ChatGPT connector for Jamf Pro using the new Model Context Protocol (MCP)\!

## What I Built
Created a proof-of-concept that lets ChatGPT query and manage Jamf devices using natural language. You can now ask ChatGPT questions like:
- "Find all MacBooks that haven't checked in recently"
- "Show me device compliance for the last 30 days"
- "Search for devices assigned to marketing"

## Key Features
✅ 5-minute setup with local tunneling
✅ Uses ChatGPT's new MCP Connector feature (BETA)
✅ No authentication required for POC testing
✅ Open source and fork-ready

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript/Node.js
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- JSON-RPC over HTTP
- Cloudflare Tunnels for local dev
- Jamf Pro API integration

## Why This Matters
This opens up new possibilities for IT admins to interact with their device management systems using conversational AI. Imagine troubleshooting device issues or generating compliance reports just by chatting with ChatGPT\!

The code is open source and designed to be easily forked for your own MCP projects. Would love to hear your thoughts or see what you build with it\!
