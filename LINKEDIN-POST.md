# LinkedIn Post - Jamf AI Agent Launch

🚀 Excited to share a major update to the Jamf MCP Server - now with AI-powered natural language support! 

🤖 What's New:
The Jamf MCP Server now includes an AI agent that lets you manage Apple devices using conversational commands. Instead of remembering API endpoints or tool names, you can simply type:
- "Show all computers that haven't checked in for 30 days"
- "List policies assigned to the Sales department"
- "Get details for John's MacBook"

🛠️ Technical Highlights:
- Built with TypeScript and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK
- Supports multiple AI providers (AWS Bedrock, OpenAI)
- Maintains full backwards compatibility with existing MCP clients
- Zero-config setup with environment variables

💡 Why This Matters:
IT administrators can now interact with Jamf Pro more intuitively, reducing the learning curve and increasing productivity. The natural language interface makes complex device management tasks accessible to team members regardless of their API expertise.

🔒 Security First:
All credentials are managed through environment variables, with comprehensive documentation and examples included.
